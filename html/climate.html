  <h2 class="white">Climate Change Impacts</h2>
  <p> Beijing is home to more than over <em>20 million people</em> and many of them expiernce the damage caused by climate change. Due to the increase in heat, and humidity many of Beijing's citizens are prone to sicknesses and are at a increased risk of having sudden heat strokes. Over the last decade <em>droughts</em> have been increasingly common and have gotten longer due to the increasing temperature which is a product of climate change. </p>
  <hr>
  <p> <em>Beijing's yearly temperature </em>is projected to increase every year, meaning more risks of diseases being transmitted and people having heat strokes. Because of the more inconsistent temperature changes rain becomes more common. This leads to <em>flash flooding</em> from rain, but also long term flooding which will be more common as climate change gets worse. Beijing is an attractive global market, so it is likely that climate change only get worse</p>
